msgid "Sometimes this is enough, but usually you will want to specify additional files to distribute.  The typical way to do this is to write a *manifest template*, called :file:`MANIFEST.in` by default.  The manifest template is just a list of instructions for how to generate your manifest file, :file:`MANIFEST`, which is the exact list of files to include in your source distribution.  The :command:`sdist` command processes this template and generates a manifest based on its instructions and what it finds in the filesystem."

All of this is done *after* the standard include set, so you can exclude files from the standard set with explicit instructions in the manifest template.  (Or, you can use the :option:`!--no-defaults` option to disable the standard set entirely.)  There are several other commands available in the manifest template mini-language; see section :ref:`sdist-cmd`."
