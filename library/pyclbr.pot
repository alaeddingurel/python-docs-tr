msgid "The :mod:`pyclbr` module provides limited information about the functions, classes, and methods defined in a python-coded module.  The information is sufficient to implement a module browser.  The information is extracted from the python source code rather than by importing the module, so this module is safe to use with untrusted code. This restriction makes it impossible to use this module with modules not implemented in Python, including all standard and optional extension modules."

msgid "Return a dictionary mapping module-level class names to class descriptors.  If possible, descriptors for imported base classes are included.  Parameter *module* is a string with the name of the module to read; it may be the name of a module within a package.  If given, *path* is a sequence of directory paths prepended to ``sys.path``, which is used to locate the module source code."

msgid "Return a dictionary-based tree containing a function or class descriptors for each function and class defined in the module with a ``def`` or ``class`` statement.  The returned dictionary maps module-level function and class names to their descriptors.  Nested objects are entered into the children dictionary of their parent.  As with readmodule, *module* names the module to be read and *path* is prepended to sys.path.  If the module being read is a package, the returned dictionary has a key ``'__path__'`` whose value is a list containing the package search path."
