Most systems require it to be in the range 0--127, and produce undefined results otherwise.  Some systems have a convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes, but these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command line syntax errors and 1 for all other kind of errors.  If another type of object is passed, ``None`` is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is printed to :data:`stderr` and results in an exit code of 1.
