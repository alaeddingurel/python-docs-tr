msgid ":func:`shutil.copyfile`, :func:`shutil.copy`, :func:`shutil.copy2`, :func:`shutil.copytree` and :func:`shutil.move` use platform-specific \"fast-copy\" syscalls on Linux, macOS and Solaris in order to copy the file more efficiently. \"fast-copy\" means that the copying operation occurs within the kernel, avoiding the use of userspace buffers in Python as in \"``outfd.write(infd.read())``\". On Windows :func:`shutil.copyfile` uses a bigger default buffer size (1 MiB instead of 16 KiB) and a :func:`memoryview`-based variant of :func:`shutil.copyfileobj` is used. The speedup for copying a 512 MiB file within the same partition is about +26% on Linux, +50% on macOS and +40% on Windows. Also, much less CPU cycles are consumed. See :ref:`shutil-platform-dependent-efficient-copy-operations` section. (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola' in :issue:`25427`.)"

msgid "The duality of ``Modules/Setup.dist`` and ``Modules/Setup`` has been removed.  Previously, when updating the CPython source tree, one had to manually copy ``Modules/Setup.dist`` (inside the source tree) to ``Modules/Setup`` (inside the build tree) in order to reflect any changes upstream.  This was of a small benefit to packagers at the expense of a frequent annoyance to developers following CPython development, as forgetting to copy the file could produce build failures."
